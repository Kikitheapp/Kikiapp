# Sexyeducation
This is Kikiapp. We are creating an app that curates sexual health resources for the queer community. We are a platform for queer sexual education, for sexual liberation, for knowledge, for power, joy, freedom, and connection. Stay tuned for the launch of our app. For now, check out our blog, sign up for our newsletter, and follow us on social media.

Kiki was founded in 2020 to address the gap in sexual health resources and education for the LGBTQIA+ community. This lack of education starts early: one study found that fewer than 5% of LGBT youth have access to positive representations of LGBT sexuality in their sex ed classes. This renders us essentially invisible and creates a barrier to having safe, pleasurable sex lives. We also face healthcare disparities like doctors who are not educated in queer sexual health needs that lead to higher rates of STIs and fewer preventative healthcare visits. Learning about sexual health and pleasure shouldnâ€™t be daunting. We created Kiki as a way to counter the cisgender, heterosexual-centered sex ed that is taught in most schools in the US. This platform aims to create space for fun, fact-based, and easy-to-understand discussions about sex. For the newly out to the old pros, for everything from basic anatomy to butt plugs, Kiki is about inclusion for all. All genders, all sexualities, all types of sex and relationships.

## Getting Started - Development
Kiki app uses React and Bootstrap for frontend frameworks and Express as a 
backend to provide API services and serve the web app in a production 
environment. However, we will continue to use the react-scripts that are 
provided to maintain development efficiency. 

When you are ready to test your work, you can launch the Kiki app frontend using 
```
npm start
```

To launch the express backend, you will need to open a separate terminal to the 
project root folder and run
```
npm run server
```

## Getting Started - Production
When you are ready to launch the app to production, you will need to build the 
app and then run the server, which will serve the web app and provide API 
services. This can be done using a single script provided in the package.json.

To build and launch the app in production run
```
npm run prod
```
