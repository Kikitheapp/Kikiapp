              <h3>Introduction</h3>
              <p>
                Kiki the App LLC (<span className="fw-bold">“Kiki,” “Company,” “we”</span> or 
                <span className="fw-bold">“us”</span>) is committed to protecting your privacy.
                The following policy (<span className="fw-bold">“Privacy Policy”</span>) 
                describes our practices for collecting, using, maintaining, and disclosing 
                information that we collect from you or that you provide to us when you visit our 
                website (our <span className="fw-bold">“Site”</span>), use our mobile application 
                (<span className="fw-bold">“App”</span>), or use any other products and services 
                made available by us (collectively with the Site, the <span className="fw-bold">
                  “Services”</span>).<br />
                  <br />
                We ask that you read this Privacy Policy carefully to understand our policies and practices
                regarding your information and how we will treat it. The use of information collected through our
                Services will be limited to the purposes described under this Privacy Policy and our Terms of
                Service (or other relevant customer contracts). By accessing or using the Services, you agree to
                this Privacy Policy. Please be aware that if you are using the Services on behalf of an entity,
                you are agreeing to this Privacy Policy for that entity and are representing to us that you have
                the authority to do so (in which case <span className="fw-bold">“you”</span> will refer to that 
                entity). If you do not agree with our policies and practices, your choice is not to use the 
                Services. <br />
                <br />
                This Privacy Policy may change from time to time. If we make any changes, we will post the
                changes on this page and indicate at the top of this page the date the policy was last revised.
                We will also notify you of any material changes either through a pop-up notice, email or through
                other reasonable means. Any such changes are effective immediately when we post them, and
                apply to all access to and use of the Services thereafter. Your continued use of the Services
                after the date any such changes become effective constitutes your acceptance of the new
                policy.
              </p>
              <h3>Information We Collect and How We Collect Information</h3>
              <p>
                This policy sets out what personal data we might collect, how we process and protect that data
                and the lawful grounds for that processing. In most cases, the lawful ground will be that the
                processing: (i) is necessary for our legitimate interests in carrying out our business, including to
                grow and improve our Services, provided those interests are not outweighed by your rights and
                interests (<span className="fw-bold">“Legitimate Interests”</span>), (ii) is necessary to perform 
                a contract with you (<span className="fw-bold">“Contract”</span>), or (iii) we have a legal 
                obligation to carry out the processing (<span className="fw-bold">“Legal Obligation”</span>). Where
                processing is based on your consent (<span className="fw-bold">“Consent”</span>), we will identify the processing purposes and
                provide you with relevant information to make the processing fair and transparent.
              </p>
              <h3>Information You Provide</h3>
              <p>

                all of the following types of information when you register with our Services, submit comments
                and other content, or directly contact us with questions or feedback:

                </ol>
              </p>
              <p>
                The information you provide may include Personal Information. “Personal Information” is
                information that identifies you personally (whether alone or in combination).

              <h3>Third-Party Information Collection</h3>

                providers may use these technologies to collect information that helps us with traffic
                measurement, research, and analytics.<br />
                <br />
                The information collected and stored by third parties remains subject to their policies and
                practices. We do not control these third parties’ tracking technologies or how they may be used.<br />

                parties. <br />
                <br />

                interpretations of trends for both internal and external purposes.<br />
