              providers at the sole election of your credit card issuer. Your credit card issuer may give you the

              damages, judgments, awards, losses, costs, expenses or fees (including reasonable attorneys&#39;
              fees) arising out of or relating to your violation of these Terms or your use of the Services or
              your use of any information obtained through the Services.
            </p>
            <h3>Governing Law</h3>
            <p>
              No matter where you’re located, the laws of the state of New York will govern these Terms and
              the relationship between you and the Company as if you signed these Terms in New York,
              without regard to New York state’s conflicts of laws rules. If any provisions of these Terms are
              inconsistent with any applicable law, those provisions will be superseded and/or modified only to
              the extent such provisions are inconsistent. The parties agree to submit to the federal or state
              courts in New York for exclusive jurisdiction of any dispute arising out of or related to your use
              of the Services or your breach of these Terms.
            </p>
            <h3>Arbitration</h3>
            <p>
              At our sole discretion, we may require you to submit any disputes arising from these Terms,
              including disputes arising from or concerning their interpretation, violation, invalidity, non-
              performance, or termination, to final and binding arbitration under the Rules of Arbitration of the
              American Arbitration Association. The arbitration shall be seated in New York, New York.
            </p>    
            <h3>Severability</h3>
            <p>
              If it turns out that any part of these Terms is invalid, void, or for any reason unenforceable, that
              term will be deemed severable and limited or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary. The
              limitation or elimination of the term will not affect any other terms.
            </p>
            <h3>Entire Agreement</h3>
            <p>
              These Terms constitute the entire agreement between you and the Company and supersede all
              prior or contemporaneous communications and proposals, whether electronic, oral, or written
              with respect to these Services. Any rights not expressly granted herein are reserved.
            </p>    
            <h3>Force Majeure</h3>
            <p>
              We take our commitment to customers seriously, and we’ll do what we can for you. However,
              sometimes things may come up that are outside of our control. We will not be liable for any
              failure to perform any of our obligations stated in these Terms if the failure results from a cause
              beyond our reasonable control, including—without limitation—mechanical, electronic or
              communications failure or degradation, strikes or other labor disputes (whether or not relating to
              our workforce), restraints or delays affecting carriers, or our inability or delay in obtaining
              supplies of adequate or suitable materials.
            </p>    
            <h3>Assignment</h3>
            <p>
              You cannot assign, transfer or sublicense these Terms without first obtaining our consent. We
              may assign, transfer, or delegate any of our rights and obligations without consent. These
              Terms do not create any agency, partnership, joint venture, or employment relationship, and
              neither party has any authority to bind the other in any respect.
            </p>    
            <h3>Waiver</h3>
            <p>
              If we do not enforce any part of these Terms, it does not mean we give up the right to later
              enforce that or any other part of these Terms. In order for any waiver of compliance with these
              Terms to be binding, we must provide you with written notice of such waiver through one of our
              authorized representatives.
            </p> 
            <h3>Release</h3>
            <p>
              You release the Company and our successors from all losses, damages, rights, and demands
              and actions of any kind, including personal injuries, death, and property damage, that are
              directly or indirectly related to or arise from your use of the Services (collectively, 
              <span className="fw-bold">“Claims”</span>). If you are a California resident, you hereby waive 
              California Civil Code Section 1542, which states, “A general release does not extend to claims that the 
              creditor or releasing party does not know or suspect to exist in his favor at the time of executing the 
              release, which, if known by him would have materially affected his settlement with the debtor.” This 
              release does not apply to any Claims for unconscionable commercial practice by the Company or fraud, 
              deception, false, promise, misrepresentation or concealment, or suppression or omission of any material 
              fact in connection with the Services.
            </p> 
            <h3>Comments, Concerns and Complaints</h3>
            <p>
              All feedback, comments, requests for technical support and other communications relating to
              the Services should be directed to: support@kikitheapp.com.
