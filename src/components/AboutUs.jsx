          We are Kiki. We are creating an app that curates sexual health
          resources for the queer community. We are a platform for queer sexual
          education, for sexual liberation, for knowledge, for power, joy,
          freedom, and connection. Stay tuned for the launch of our app. For
          now, check out our blog, sign up for our newsletter, and follow us on
          social media.

          Kiki was founded in 2020 to address the gap in sexual health resources
          and education for the LGBTQIA+ community. This lack of education
          starts early: one study found that fewer than 5% of LGBT youth have
          access to positive representations of LGBT sexuality in their sex ed
          classes. This renders us essentially invisible and creates a barrier
          to having safe, pleasurable sex lives. We also face healthcare
          disparities like doctors who are not educated in queer sexual health
          needs that lead to higher rates of STIs and fewer preventative
          healthcare visits. Learning about sexual health and pleasure shouldnâ€™t
          be daunting. We created Kiki as a way to counter the cisgender,
          heterosexual-centered sex ed that is taught in most schools in the US.
          This platform aims to create space for fun, fact-based, and
          easy-to-understand discussions about sex. For the newly out to the old
          pros, for everything from basic anatomy to butt plugs, Kiki is about
          inclusion for all. All genders, all sexualities, all types of sex and
          relationships.

                  Krista White is a queer, Black writer and actor who decided to
                  take a UX Design class on a whim in 2019. She fell in love
                  with her final project, a prototype for the sexual health app
                  that would become Kiki. She is thrilled to be working with an
                  incredible team to bring this work to fruition. Based in New
                  York City, she loves sci-fi, baking, and writing fiction.
