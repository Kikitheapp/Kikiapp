        <p>We are Kiki. We are creating an app that curates sexual health resources for the queer community. We are a
            platform for queer sexual education, for sexual liberation, for knowledge, for power, joy, freedom, and
            connection. Stay tuned for the launch of our app. For now, check out our blog, sign up for our newsletter,
            and
            follow us on social media.</p>
        <p>Kiki was founded in 2020 to address the gap in sexual health resources and education for the LGBTQIA+
            community.
            This lack of education starts early: one study found that fewer than 5% of LGBT youth have access to
            positive
            representations of LGBT sexuality in their sex ed classes. This renders us essentially invisible and creates
            a
            barrier to having safe, pleasurable sex lives. We also face healthcare disparities like doctors who are not
            educated in queer sexual health needs that lead to higher rates of STIs and fewer preventative healthcare
            visits.

            Learning about sexual health and pleasure shouldnâ€™t be daunting. We created Kiki as a way to counter the
            cisgender, heterosexual-centered sex ed that is taught in most schools in the US. This platform aims to
            create
            space for fun, fact-based, and easy-to-understand discussions about sex. For the newly out to the old pros,
            for
            everything from basic anatomy to butt plugs, Kiki is about inclusion for all. All genders, all sexualities,
            all types of sex and relationships.
